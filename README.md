# Invoice Insights: Hackathon Submission Story

## Inspiration

The inspiration for "Invoice Insights" came from a common frustration: the tedious and time-consuming process of managing invoices. Many individuals and small businesses struggle with:

*   Manually extracting data from PDFs and images.
*   Trying to remember what each invoice was for.
*   Losing track of recurring subscriptions.
*   Difficulty in understanding spending patterns.

I saw an opportunity to leverage AI to automate these tasks, transforming a painful chore into a source of valuable financial clarity. The goal was to create a tool that not only digitizes invoices but also provides intelligent insights to help users manage their finances more effectively and save precious time.

## What it does

Invoice Insights is an AI-powered web application designed to revolutionize invoice management. It allows users to:

*   **Upload Invoices:** Easily upload invoice PDFs or images through a clean web interface.
*   **Automated Data Extraction:** Leverages AI (simulated Document AI with Genkit and Gemini) to automatically extract key information like vendor, date, total amount, and line items.
*   **Intelligent Summarization:** Generates concise, plain-English summaries of each invoice's content.
*   **Smart Categorization:** Suggests relevant expense categories for each invoice, which users can override.
*   **Recurrence Detection:** Identifies invoices likely to be recurring monthly expenses, with an option for manual toggling.
*   **Centralized Dashboard:** Displays a list of all processed invoices, showing vendor, date, total, summary, and categories at a glance. Users can search and view detailed information for each invoice.
*   **Spending Analysis:** Provides a visual breakdown of spending by category.
*   **Similar Invoice Discovery:** Uses vector embeddings and semantic search (via MongoDB Atlas Vector Search) to find invoices with similar content.
*   **Manual Entry & Editing:** Offers flexibility by allowing manual entry of invoice data and editing of previously processed invoices.
*   **Secure User Accounts:** Features user authentication to keep financial data private.

Essentially, Invoice Insights transforms raw invoice documents into organized, searchable, and insightful financial data.

## How I built it

"Invoice Insights" is a full-stack web application built with a modern tech stack:

*   **Frontend:**
    *   **Next.js 15 (App Router):** For the React framework, leveraging Server Components and Server Actions for efficient data handling and mutations.
    *   **React & TypeScript:** For building interactive UI components with type safety.
    *   **ShadCN/UI & Tailwind CSS:** For a comprehensive set of pre-built, accessible UI components and utility-first CSS styling.
    *   **Lucide React:** For icons.
    *   **Recharts:** For rendering the spending distribution bar chart.
    *   **React Hook Form:** For managing complex form state and validation.
*   **Backend (Server Actions & AI Flows):**
    *   **Genkit (v1.x):** The core AI orchestration framework, used to define and manage flows that interact with Google AI models.
    *   **Google AI (Gemini models via Genkit):**
        *   Document AI capabilities (simulated via Gemini Pro Vision) for extracting data from invoice images/PDFs (`extractInvoiceDataFlow`).
        *   Text generation for summarizing invoice content (`summarizeInvoiceFlow`).
        *   Text generation and classification for suggesting expense categories (`categorizeInvoiceFlow`).
        *   Text analysis for detecting likely recurring expenses (`detectRecurrenceFlow`).
        *   Generating embeddings for invoice summaries to power semantic search.
    *   **Node.js (via Next.js Server Actions):** For backend logic.
*   **Database:**
    *   **MongoDB Atlas:** Used as the primary database to store user accounts, invoice metadata, extracted data, AI-generated summaries, categories, and embeddings.
    *   **MongoDB Atlas Vector Search:** Implemented to find similar invoices based on the semantic similarity of their summary embeddings.
*   **File Storage:**
    *   **Google Cloud Storage (GCS):** To securely store uploaded invoice files (PDFs/images).
*   **Authentication:**
    *   Custom email/password authentication implemented using bcrypt for password hashing and MongoDB for user storage, managed via Server Actions and React Context.
*   **Deployment (Conceptual):**
    *   Designed with Firebase App Hosting in mind (as per Firebase Studio environment).

**Key Architectural Decisions:**

1.  **Server Actions for Mutations:** I opted for Next.js Server Actions for all data mutations (uploads, manual entries, updates, deletions) to simplify the client-server interaction and keep data handling close to the server.
2.  **Genkit for AI Orchestration:** Using Genkit allowed for structured AI flows, making it easier to manage prompts, input/output schemas, and interactions with different AI models.
3.  **MongoDB for Flexibility and Vector Search:** MongoDB's flexible schema was suitable for storing diverse invoice data, and its Atlas Vector Search capability was crucial for the "similar invoices" feature.
4.  **Decoupled AI Flows:** Each AI task (extraction, summarization, categorization, recurrence detection) was implemented as a separate, reusable Genkit flow, promoting modularity.

## Challenges I ran into

1.  **Prompt Engineering for Invoice Data Extraction:** Reliably extracting structured data (vendor, date, total, line items) from diverse invoice formats using a general vision model like Gemini Pro Vision was challenging. It required careful prompt engineering and accepting that the AI might not always be perfect, leading to the inclusion of manual entry and editing features as essential complements.
2.  **Managing Asynchronous Operations & State with Server Actions:** Integrating Server Actions, especially those involving multiple AI calls and database operations, with client-side state updates (using `useActionState` and `React.startTransition`) required careful handling to ensure UI responsiveness and correct error reporting.
3.  **Invoice Schema Design:** Deciding on a comprehensive yet flexible schema for invoices that could accommodate both AI-extracted data and user-entered/edited data, including fields like embeddings and AI-suggested categories, took several iterations.
4.  **Implementing Vector Search:** Setting up and correctly querying the MongoDB Atlas Vector Search index involved understanding how to generate query vectors and structure the aggregation pipeline for optimal results.
5.  **UI Consistency for Edit vs. Create Modes:** Ensuring the `ManualInvoiceForm` behaved consistently and correctly pre-filled data when switching between "create" and "edit" modes, especially with dynamic fields like line items and categories, required careful state management and `react-hook-form` usage.
6.  **User Experience for AI-Generated Content:** Balancing AI automation with user control was key. For instance, allowing users to override AI-suggested categories or manually mark recurrence was an important design choice made after realizing AI isn't infallible.
7.  **Debugging `useActionState`:** Understanding the nuances of `useActionState` and ensuring the action dispatch function and state were correctly passed and handled between parent and child components (especially with the `ManualInvoiceForm`) took some debugging to resolve issues like "Cannot read .then of undefined".
